Away Goals Rule Calculator

This is a little problem I thought of whilst playing FIFA, how easy is it to make the calculations needed to work out the away goals rule used in Champions League matches.

This is a simple haskell program that will calculate whether a two leg fixture is a tie or which team won using the away goals rule for two sets of results over two legs.

Team A always plays at home first.
